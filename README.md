This website boilerplate is built using [Docusaurus](https://v2.docusaurus.io/). You can view it [here](https://icpc-guc-community.github.io/website-boilerplate/).

### Requirements

* [Yarn](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/) version >= 1.5 (which can be checked by running yarn version).

### Installation
